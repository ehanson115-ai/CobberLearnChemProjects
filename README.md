PubChemFetcher: 
This Python script uses PubChemPy to fetch and display key chemical properties for any compound by name. It retrieves the following descriptors: Molecular Formula, Molecular Weight, SMILES string, Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA), and Heavy Atom Count. The output is formatted neatly for easy reading. The script is reusable for any compound, and can be run interactively to analyze multiple compounds without editing the code.
