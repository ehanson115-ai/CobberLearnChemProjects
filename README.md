PubChemFetcher: This Python script uses PubChemPy to fetch and display key chemical properties for any compound by name. It retrieves the following descriptors: Molecular Formula, Molecular Weight, SMILES string, Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA), and Heavy Atom Count. The output is formatted neatly for easy reading. The script is reusable for any compound, and can be run interactively to analyze multiple compounds without editing the code.  
  
MoleculeExplorer: his Python script allows users to input one or more SMILES strings and calculates key chemical properties for each molecule using RDKit. Properties include: Exact Molecular Weight, Hydrogen Bond Donors, Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA), Total number of atoms, Number of bonds, Number of rings, Number of rotatable bonds, The program outputs results in a clean, easy-to-read table and supports analyzing multiple molecules easily from a SMILES string and molecules name inputted by a user.
